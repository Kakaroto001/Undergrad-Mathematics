"That's right. I knew it from the start. What lies on the other side of the storm... is just an even more furious storm. No matter how many times you fall, you must keep on picking up your scattered fragments. It's wandering without end." - Rey Kiriyama

As learning through problems is the only way to get better at them, this repository is overridden with problems, which is adviced you do. I include my own solutions to the problems, but keep in mind that _my solutions_ are in most cases a quick sketch, or wrong. Yet you may still be able to learn something from my mistakes so I append them anyway.

For most problems and documents there should be a LaTeX file included in addition to the pdf as to facilitate modification and distribution. I advise most people to learn the basics of LaTeX for ease of use.
